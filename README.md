# Summary
This repository tracks my [OSSU Computer Science](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) degree progress.

>The OSSU curriculum is a complete education in computer science using online materials. It's not merely for career training or professional development. It's for those who want a proper, well-rounded grounding in concepts fundamental to all computing disciplines, and for those who have the discipline, will, and (most importantly!) good habits to obtain this education largely on their own, but with support from a worldwide community of fellow learners. 
>
>It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate computer science majors, minus general education (non-CS) requirements, as it is assumed most of the people following this curriculum are already educated outside the field of CS.

# Disclaimer
I will not be following the official `OSSU Computer Science` degree program.  
The reason for that is as follows:  
>By the time I am starting this project (`July/2018`), I have a bachelor's degree in Civil Engineering and I've been working as a junior developer for the last four months.  
>Considering my engineeing background it is safe to say that I am able to skip both Core and Avanced Math courses.  
>Furthermore, I have talked to my current boss (over 20 years of experience) and a couple of mentor-friends (about 5 years of experience) about this curriculum and they have highlighted some courses and also discarded a few others that would not add much to me due to my current experience.
